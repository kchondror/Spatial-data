# Spatial-data
In this project, our objective was to design and implement the R Star Tree structure in Python.
The R Star Tree serves as an indexing catalog specifically designed for storing and managing geographical data.
By leveraging the capabilities of the Python programming language, we have developed a fully functional implementation of this tree structure.

The R Star Tree provides an efficient and optimized solution for indexing geographical data.
It organizes the data in a hierarchical manner, enabling fast retrieval and search operations. 

With our implementation, users can conveniently store and manage geographic datasets within the R Star Tree. 
The tree structure supports ONLY in-memory usage.
